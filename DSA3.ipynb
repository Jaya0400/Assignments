    "Selection Sort:Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm \n",
    "in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. \n",
    "Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.The smallest element is selected from \n",
    "the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. \n",
    "This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.This algorithm is not suitable \n",
    "for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of Ο(n2), where n is the number of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort:Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the\n",
    "intended order.Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array \n",
    "move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion Sort: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards \n",
    "in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are \n",
    "picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge Sort: Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, \n",
    "calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Sort:Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the \n",
    "given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Heap Sort:Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection \n",
    "sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. We repeat the same process for\n",
    "the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting Sort:is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having \n",
    "distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output \n",
    "sequence.\n",
